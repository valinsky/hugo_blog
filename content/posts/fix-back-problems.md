I sit a lot. If you're reading this you probably sit a lot too. We sit a lot because we spend a lot of time on the computer. We sit in chairs, couches, beds, sometimes with proper posture, sometimes with bad posture.

My posture used to be everything but proper. I was hunched over, slouching, shoulders forward, leaned too much on one side, head forward, neck bent, you name it. And I rolled with it until my back started to act up. At first my ignorance didn't let me pay much attention to it. It wasn't until it became serious that I knew I needed to change something.

All this time sitting in weird positions made my back muscles weak and my back bones *disfigured?*. My body was not sitting in the right position, and sooner or later I started feeling the consequences. I was feeling old. When I was moving I didn't feel like a 20 something individual, but way older. I had to put myself back on the right path.

Now I'm happy to say that after some trial and error with different exercises and methods, I completely fixed my back and all the pain and discomfort is gone. I'm always keen on learning and exploring new things, but I think these techniques will sustain my healthy back for years to come, and I hope you will find them useful as well.

A big back problem can be muscle imbalances. For example, you get rounded shoulders because the front delt muscles are stringer than the back delt muscles. We need to balance these two.

Another problem is that we get caught up in our daily problems, and we don't pay attention to our posture. Bt simply being more aware of our body, we can counteract involuntary movements that lead to bad posture.

### Face Pulls

If there was one exercise I would recommend everyone doing no matter what, it's face pulls. It's simply amazing. If done the right way. I'll let Jeff explain the right way to do it.

By doing face pulls you open up your chest and shoulders, put your upper spine in it's proper place and get rid of muscles imbalances. Goodbye rounded shoulders.

Face pulls alone, done properly and consistently can fix your upper back.

### Band Pull Apart

Band pull aparts are the sidekick to face pulls. For people who don't have access to the equipment needed to do proper face pulls, band pull aparts are a great alternative since you only need a resistance band. I would recommend you do both. Again I'm going to let Jeff explain how to do it properly.

The benefits are similar to face pulls. Band pull apart will help with those nasty muscle imbalances and put your shoulders and spine back in their proper place.

### Hanging

Grab a bar and hang there for as long as you can. Just by hanging you strengthen the upper back muscles and again, you get rid of muscle imbalances. Besides that, you streth your joints and release all that tension that was built up throughout your day or night.

### Spinal Decompression

Sitting makes the discs in your spine to compress which builds up pressure between them. The more you sit the more pressure gets built up. With time, this leads to lower back pain and in some cases to a [bulging disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation).

### Squats and Abs

Because of too much sitting I've started suffering from a condition called anterior pelvic tilt. If you have weak glutes and abs, your pelvis will slightly rotate because the glutes and abs can't counteract the rotation force. If you think you suffer from this, you should try to fix it as soon as possible. It can be a pretty nasty condition.

To counteract these muscle imbalances, you have to work your glutes, like doing squats, and abs.

### Awareness

It's easy to lose body awareness when sitting. We get caught up in our daily problems and when we get our awareness back we find oursleves in all these weird positions. By simply being more aware of your self and body, you will be able to have a better posture.

I have to admit that I stole the title of this article from [Thích Nhất Hạnh's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh) book [How to Sit](https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Essentials-Thich-Nhat-Hanh/dp/1937006581). In the book he tells the reader how to sit mindfully and joifully while maintaining awareness. I highly recommend it. There are also other books in the series like How to Relax, How to See, etc.

### Honorable mentions

Running and swimming


After getting rid of muscle imbalances and constantly exercising being aware, I got rid of most if not all my back problems. I hope you will find this information helpful and you will get a strong and healthy back.
