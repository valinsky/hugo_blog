At some point during the day today I saw I had three missed calls. One was from my mom, and two from my friends. I got back to them, put the phone down and continued with my daily activities.

Right then and there I had a thought, that todays phones make me miss more calls than a few years ago.

#### Smartphones are a drug

[Smartphone addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problematic_smartphone_use) is a real thing. Apps and the smartphone itself are specifically designed to be used as much as possible. And it's working.

I observed that addiction on myself. A lot of times I would unconsciously take the phone out of my pocket just so I can get that [dopamine shot](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/04/has-dopamine-got-us-hooked-on-tech-facebook-apps-addiction). I didn't have a specific thing I wanted to do on my phone, it was more or less automatic. I would go on social media, open my email, check the weather, but I wasn't really ***doing*** anything. Sometimes I would catch myself in the middle of doing nothing and thinking ***what the fuck am I doing right now?***

This whole thing lasted for a couple of years, before I realized the seriousness of the problem. Unfortunately I didn't take action immediatly. Even after that realization, I would still mindlessly go on my phone and waste time doing random useless shit. The addiction was strong. I knew that something had to change.

I ended up deleting a lot of useless apps that come across as being useful. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat... we don't actually need them. Yet they have the power to control our actions and emotions. When and if you find yourself constantly on an app, ask yourself, **do you really need it**? I'm telling you right now, you probably don't.

I'm also limiting overall phone usage. I try to not have it close to me when I'm programming, writing an article, reading a book, watching a movie etc. I'm working on gaining back my attention span by trying to be fully enganged in the task at hand. And it's been going great.

#### I miss most phone calls now

One downside to this is that now I'm missing almost all the calls I get. I know texts are king, but not always. For example I still talk with my parents a lot on the phone. I live in the US and they are in Romania, and while we somewhat plan our phone conversations, random phone calls happen all the time. I miss a lot of them. Most of the time I call back immediately and it's all good.

I remember way back in the day when I had a [Siemens A50](https://hdimages-raw.s3.amazonaws.com/siemensa50-1354158248-4.jpg) I didn't miss almost any call. Everyone was so excited to talk on the phone. Things have changed.

#### [It's a trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F4qzPbcFiA)

I think it's amazing how the evolution of the phone makes me miss more phone calls now than before. Maybe because it's not a phone anymore.

It's a computer that tries really hard to be an extension of your thinking process and to make you believe you're dependent on it... while you can also use it as a phone.

Don't fall prey to it.
