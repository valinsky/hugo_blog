The ad industry is a market that has seen significant growth since the rise of the internet, with total spending reaching over [$129 billion in 2019](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/050815/trends-and-growth-digital-advertising-industry.asp#citation-10), with an estimate of [$322.5 billion in 2020, and $640.2 billion by 2027](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-digital-advertising-and-marketing-industry-301093781.html).

The ad industry thrives on knowing as much as possible about their potential customers, with the purpose of generating personalized ads, which led to the development of highly efficient and invasive online tracking tools.

Since the ad industry makes its profit in [fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp), the properties of the fiat monetary system dictate how the ad ecosystem behaves and what opportunities are presented to it, and how the ad market profits of off the fiat enslavement of society, further enhancing this aspect.


### Keynesian economics

[Keynesian economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp) proposes that spending is necessary to sustain a growing economy. The theory suggests that spending boosts economic output which in turn generates more income, which can then be used for even more spending. If workers are willing to spend their income, that becomes income for a business which in turn spends it on business needs like equipment, taxes and worker salaries. Workers use the salary to spend it on other goods and services, and so on.

Keynes believed, among other things, that individuals should **save less and spend more**, because in his view that's how an economy can grow.

How can the population be incentivised to spend and not save? You force them to, by creating a system which promotes spending. The properties of the monetary system in use dictate how that money is being used. If a system is created where money loses value over time, the sooner that money is spent, the better.

If you hold an asset that you know will be less valuable in the future, you will want to sell it as soon as possible to get back as much value as you can.

### Fiat money

Enter [fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp), the most widely used form of currency today. Most of us get payed in fiat and use it to buy other goods and services.

> Fiat money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government that issued it. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government, rather than the worth of a commodity backing it as is the case for commodity money. Most modern paper currencies are fiat currencies, including the U.S. dollar, the euro, and other major global currencies.

> Since fiat money is not a scarce or fixed resource like ~~gold~~ bitcoin, central banks have much greater control over its supply, which gives them the power to manage economic variables such as credit supply, liquidity, interest rates, and money velocity.

What this means in laymans terms is that Central Banks can create money out of thin air.

{{< figure src="/images/ads_tracking_fiat/fed_balance_sheet.jpg" title="Fed Balance Sheet" caption="Fed Balance Sheet" position="center" >}}

Central Banks use that freshly printed money to buy government issued assets, and the government uses that money however it deems necessary. It can buy assets like stocks, real estate, oil contracts etc. In extreme cases it can [bail out banks or airline companies]() or even create stimulus checks for the general population like it happened in the US during the 2020 Covid pandemic. It can even finance war.

For reference, in the Fed Balance Sheet image above, compare the spike during the 2008 financial crisis with the spike during the 2020 Covid pandemic. Central banks printed at least 5 times more in 2020.

### Inflation

The universal law of supply and demand dictates that when demand for an asset increases, the price of that asset increases. When governments buy assets with fresh printed money out of thin air, those assets become more expensive for everyone else.

The chapter "The Mirage of Inflation" from the book Economics in one lesson by Henry Hazlitt beautifully explains how inflation works.

> Let's say group A got the printed money and it uses it to buy goods from B. Group B, as a result of higher sales and prices, will now in turn buy more goods and services from a still further group, C. Group C in turn will be able to raise its prices and will have more income to spend on group D, and so on, until the rise in prices and money incomes has covered virtually the whole nation. When the process has been completed, nearly everybody will have a higher income measured in terms of money. But (assuming that production of goods and services has not increased) prices of goods and services will have increased correspondingly. The nation will be no richer than before.

> This does not mean, however, that everyoneâ€™s relative or absolute wealth and income will remain the same as before. On the contrary, the process of inflation is certain to affect the fortunes of one group differently from those of another. The first groups to receive the additional money will benefit the most. The money incomes of group A, for example, will have increased before prices have increased, so that they will be able to buy almost a proportionate increase in goods. The money incomes of group B will advance later, when prices have already increased somewhat; but group B will be better off in terms of goods. Meanwhile, however, the groups that have still had no advance whatever in their money incomes will find themselves compelled to pay higher prices for the things they buy, which means that they will be obliged to get along on a lower standard of living than before.

CANTILLON EFFECT

To summarize, inflation benefits the individuals who have access to it first, and the ones who get it last are by implication losers. Inflation can be seen as a transfer of wealth from one group to another group. The government and its associated institution are benefiting the most from inflation, while the working class is the one who's value is being forcefully taken away from them.

To put this into as few words as possible: **Inflation is theft!**

Inflation is a way to steal from the poor and transfer to the rich.

Because of this mechanics, you're incentivized to spend your money quick, because if you don't, the value that you create and store using fiat will be transferred to the individuals at the top of the economic food chain.

### Time Preference

Fiat money is not sound money.

> Sound money is chosen freely on the market for its salability, because it holds its value across time, because it can transfer value effectively across space, and because it can be divided and grouped into small and large scales. It is money whose supply cannot be manipulated by a coercive authority that imposes its use on others.

* **The Bitcoin Standard** by Saifedean Ammous

<br>

The supply of unsound fiat money can be inflated at will, which decreases the purchasing power of a single unit, meaning that it can't hold its value accross time, which in turn incentivizes people to spend it quickly. This is an **extremely important** aspect to understand when it comes to personal decision making, because it affects how individuals think about their future. It becomes extremelly hard, if not impossible, to plan for the future when you depend on something that increasingly loses its value the more in the future you look.

This unseen force makes individuals value the present more. This is known as high time preference.

> Time preference refers to the ratio at which individuals value the present compared to the future.

* **The Bitcoin Standard** by Saifedean Ammous

<br>

On the opposite side of the spectrum, individuals with low time preference focus more on the distant future. This is possible knowing that the money you have will not lose value over time.

We can see that Keynes was of the opinion that in order to have a sustainable economy, money has to be used in a high time preference environment. That is possible if individuals are incentivized to spend it and not save it. That is possible if the purchasing power of their money decreases over time. They can't plan for the future, because uncertainty increases the further ahead in the future they look, proportional to the decrease of their purchasing power.

This is beneficial for goverments and associated entities because while they impose a high time preference on individuals, they have only to gain from the fact that they're the first ones to spend fresh printed money on cheap assets.

In my opinion the fiat monetary system is a corrupt system that centralizes absolute power to a handful of elite individuals, creates wealth inequality, enslaves the masses and makes the rich richer. The problems generated by fiat dynamics are numerous and wide-ranging and this article barely scratches the surface. I encourage everyone to question the underlying monetary system that controls their life and not to blindly accept it because that's just how things are.

Let's talk about ads.

### Ads

The ad industry has seen imense growth during the age of the internet. Rarely do you find a commercial website free of ads.

Some of the biggest tech companies, like Google or Facebook, make most of their profit from ads. While they offer some of the best apps on the market, they're mostly patform for ads instead of tech companies.

### Show ads profit

Ads work even better if they can be customized specifically for each individual, and that's possible if everything the individual does is recorded, stored and analyzed.

The internet is full of trackers created with the sole purpose of finding out everything you do online. I wrote about different ways trackers can figure out everything you do in a [previous post about privacy](https://valinsky.me/posts/privacy-build-2020/).

If companies know everything about you from when you wake up, when yo go to bed, what things you like or dislike, what your financial situation is, your relationship or marital status, your overall well being, if you're happy, sad, depressed... They can use that to create the "want" within you.

Influence by Cialdini is an extraordinary book that i gighly recommend everybody to read. In the book Cialdini describes how easy it is to manipulate someone into doing something you want. **expand this idea**

Corporations don't want to to help you, they want to make you want to buy whatever they're selling. In almost all cases the "want" is not yours. It's created within you. Your ego combined with external influences make you think that by having something you will be happier. It's a trap.

But it's very easy to create the want if you have enormous amounts of information on a certain individual.

The want is a dangerous weapon used against you.

Combining the want with the unconscious(?) mentality / influence / brain washing of heavy spending, an individual who's not aware of these subtle forces acting on him or her doesn't stand a chance. Individuals can easily make a decision to go into debt to buy something that they think will make them happier.

Pay for expensive assets. Tech is deflationary living in an inflationary environment. Were tricked into buying expensive shit. The price of tomorrow.

We're being bombarded with all sort of overly priced products from every category imaginable. From minor products like motion detecting hand sanitizers to fancy ones like luxurious cars. There is an abundance of products our there, waiting to be bought by individuals driven by a fake and ilusory desire, created because everything they do is being tracked and monitored.

Abundance attracts high time preference.

The fiat system incentivizes the ads industry to profit phenomenally from tracking everything about users.
Corporations know individuals have a high time preference and that they will spend their money, and they compete with each other through ads to end up being the winner. For them it's not a question of "will individuals spend their money?" it's more a question of "will i be the one who gets the money that they will inevitably spend?".

The ad industry knows you have a high time preference, and they're using that as a tool against us.

And we're falling for it. The ad industry in 2019 generated.....


I do think ads have their place though. I was talking to a friend of mine and he was saying that he would prefer if ads were customized in such a way to provide him with the things that he needs. And i agree with that.

If a product can make me more efficient by saving me time and money, then i would accept a personalized ad for that specific product.

The big difference here is "need" instead of "want", and i dont think most ads are designed for that.

Besides that, I think it's absolutely necessary for me to pick what i want to share with the ad industry / internet. Online trackers shouldn't track everything by default. What a crazy idea, right?

As a side note, I believe that the ad industry is used a scape goat for agresively tracking us. When massive amopunts of data are being stored on the global population, you need some sort of reason to justify it. Doesn't have to be a good reson, just a reason. More information means more power in the information age, and that's what government entities are chasing, more power.


In Snowden's book Permanent Records written by Edward Snowden goes into detail about how the NSA and other inteligence agencies store everything about us and how they can access that data at will.
It was recently deemed illegal.

But even if we don't take intellgicence agencies and governments into account, the ad ecosystem alone is damaging for our society as whole.

It's so profitable because the monetary system upon which it resides offers the opportunity to track people and use their own personality and thoughts against them, to make them spend their money because they're influenced by the forces of high time preference and the fact that their money is constantly losing value. It's turning our society into a dumb consumer that always wants the next thing. It kills our creativity. It's killing the human spirit and turning us into dumb zombies. Only a dot in the profitability chart of corporations.

Fiat money is fucked. It makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, and provies the framework for big corps to profit of off individuals in an aggresive way, without them having any say in it.

We can chose to not pay attention to ads, but our money is still losing value, CBs keep printing and buying up cheap assets then selling them to us at a premium and we're being constinuously tracked.

Because privacy is being forcefully taken away from us and because the elites are playing against the natural forces of supply and demand by manipulating prices and the total supply of the currency in use, in my opinion we're not evolving in the right direction. It may seem like we're evolving to a blind observer (oh the iphone has 3 camers now) but in reality the society and individual spirit is being killed.

In order to continue evolving in all aspects, material, physical and spiritual, we need to regain our privacy and get rid of the disease that is fiat and start using hard sound money.
