Privacy was a hot topic in the last decade. And for good reason. A lot of companies are thriving based on the business model of gathering as much data as they can from their customers and using that data to gain influence and to generate profit.

Companies started employing intelligent and invasive tracking methods to gather user data and are wordsmiths at hiding the underlying techniques used. A lot of people have no idea how their data is being used, or that they themselves have become a product.

### Online tracking has become an art

#### Free apps

Companies may offer top notch web and mobile apps to customers *for free*. Google, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter are some of the obvious examples. Everything you do while using these apps is recorded and saved forever in a centralized database. The saved data may be used for targeted ads, tracking you online, profiling, [influencing your political views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal) etc.

#### Cookies

When you visit a website, a [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) with a unique identifier is set on your device. Next time you visit the same website, that cookie is sent in the request and the website knows that you visited it before. While cookies do offer some benefits, they are heavily used for online tracking.

#### Online fingerprinting

When you're online, website and apps have access to a wide range of properties specific to your device, like your Operating System, you systems language, systems resolution, installed fonts, screen size, browser version, and a lot of other things.

Your [online fingerprint](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/) is the unique set of these properties.

You might be the only person who visits a particular website from a particular device set to a particular language, with a particular screen size, and using a particular web browser version. Your identity can be easily revealed based on this data, without you revealing any personal information.

#### Promotions

I'm seeing more and more companies trying to get my phone number or my email through *free* gift cards, coupons etc. Trader Joe's was giving me a $5 dollars coupon if I signed up for their offer using my phone number. GTFO TJ

These are just a few examples of different tracking methods. Companies spend big budgets on figuring out better ways to track us. The more data they have on us, the more money they make, the more power and influence they have.

For a deep dive into how exactly our data is being gathered and used by corporations and governments, I highly recommend reading [Permanent Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Record_(autobiography)) by Edward Snowden.

### Encryption is our friend

Neither big corporations nor governments can crack **properly implemented** encryption. No back door bs.

[Zero-knowledge proof](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) is a type of encryption where data is encrypted before it is sent to servers, and the key to decrypt the data is only available to the user. The key is never stored on company servers. Nobody, not even companies, can decrypt the data. Only the user.

The use of open source, end to end encrypted, and even decentralized applications has seen a great increase in the past couple of years.

### Privacy build

I'm going to list the apps that I started using on a regular basis that promote encryption and privacy. While this list is by no means exhaustive, and while better alternatives may exist, it can serve as an intro into the world of privacy focused apps.

I try not to become dependend on one ecosystem. Google, Apple. I don't agree with monopolizing a specific domain. I believe in competition.
