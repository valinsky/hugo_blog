(Over)Planning can be a productivity killer and it can increase your stress.

Yes, we're all living the busy 21st century life, trying to find balance between family, partners, work, gym, nutrition, finances, school, friends, hobbies, hustling, side projects, lazyness, vacations, unforseen events, etc. Trying to order this hectic life by planning every detail would seem like a good... plan.

And it is. You need to plan out your life in order to fully experience it, but you also need to experience life in order to plan it.

You can't plan when to be inspired.

Let's say that today you plan on going to the gym tomorrow evening. Tomorrow evening comes, and all of a sudden you have a great idea for that side project you haven't worked on in a while. Just because the past you created this plan, it didn't take into account how the present you will feel. That's impossible. 

Alex Ellis wrote a [great post](https://alexanderell.is/posts/trust-in-your-unconscious/) about how the human mind works in the background, ending on this note:

Now you have to make a choice. Either stick to the "plan", or ride this impromptu inspiration train and see where it leads.

The choice between the plan your past self created for you, and where your current self is leaning towards can be a cause for increased stress (oh man i planned on doing x, but i want to do y, but if i do y, i won't do x) and a productivity killer (focusing on your inspiration now might lead to some very positive results)

So what's the answer? The answer is that planning is just another tool in your arsenal. Learn how to use it, don't let yourself be used by it.

Planning is an art.

Learn how to plan your activities and how to increase your flexibility and adaptability while letting discipline guide you towards your goals.

Your goal is to be healthy, to break your boundaries and to have a killer body, not to conform to the fictional mental bariers your mind created for you which it falsely interprets as discipline. Use your time wisely. Let today be a resting day, see where your current inspiration takes you, and tomorrow go kill it at the gym.

Another situation may arise where you're currently reading book X, and your friend talks about book Y which peaks your interest. Don't wait to finish X first. Fulfil your curiosity. Start reading Y, and if it blows your mind, finish it. Or don't. Choice is yours. You can return to X anytime.

Or trying to do to many things in a short amount of time. Don't let that be another cause of stress. Use your mind to prioritize, and whatever you do, be fully engaged in it and do it right.

Live in the moment. Be present. Learn. Adapt.

I created this website long before I actually started writing anything. I didn't feel like it was the right time yet, even though I wanted to have my own blog for a long time. I didn't force it. I could see thoughts of guilt and stress trying to creep up into my mind (your website is ready and you didn't write anything yet! looser). But I did not give in to those feelings. You have to keep that [monkey mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PkrhH-bkpk) in check.

Of course, every situation is different and you may be put in delicate situations where you need to think more about what to do next. That's fine. This life is fucking nuts anyway. Just don't let plans intervene with your growth. Where there is a will there is - at least - a way.

Sometimes you have to let things come to you, and to learn to embrace them right then and there.
